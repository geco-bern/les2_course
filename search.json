The second report exercise builds on Block 5 (Spatial upscaling).\nEach of the two reports will be equally weighted for the final grade.\nFor grading, we consider the following criteria:\n\nReproducibility (25%). Make sure your RMarkdown code is reproducible and generates a html document as intended. You can check this by letting a colleague clone your git repository and run your code on their machine. If it fails, it’s not reproducible, and you won’t get points for this aspect.\nWorkspace organisation and code (25%). Follow the principles for workspace organisation and coding as described in the AGDS book (here and here).\nPresentation (25%). This considers the appearance of the generated html document, its text and figures. Provide context, create good data visualisations, and discuss your findings.\nAnalysis and modelling (25%). This considers the correctness of analysis and modelling implementations, and the reasonable application of methods.\n\nEach student will hand in their own Report Exercises This is not a group work.\nCode duplications are not permitted and duplicated code will be graded with zero points for the respective Report Exercise.\nReports cannot be re-submitted after having received the grades. Make sure all is reproducible before you submit.\nDeadline for sending us the link by email: 08.01.2024 (course in fall semester 2023).",

I will show you through both examples in vegetation seasonality (phenology) and land-use and land-cover mapping (Block 4) that you can experiment with geo-spatial data on limited compute infrastructure.

This block introduces a workflow for digital soil mapping for using Random Forest models, predicting soil properties across a study area near Bern. The tutorial demonstrates how advances in data availability (continuous maps of climate, terrain, etc.) can be used to predict soil properties that are laborious to obtain from a limited set of soil cores (e.g., pH, water logging, etc.) and for which mapping commonly relied on spatial upscaling “by hand”. The self-guided continuation of the tutorial includes conducting variable selection, model formulation, training, evaluation, and interpretation.\n\nSession 7 - 02.11.\n\nIntroduction to digital soil mapping\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises\n\n\n\nSession 8 - 09.11.\n\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises",

    "text": "Block 5: Spatial upscaling\nLead: Benjamin Stocker\nLink to tutorial\nCreating maps with large spatial, often global coverage based on a limited set of local measurements has become popular. Digital soil mapping led the way by introducing the paradigm that (i) maps can be created based on a model that fits relationships between a locally measured variable of interest and a set of covariates, often environmental variables; and that (ii) global maps of these covariates are available and enable predicting with the fitted model to conditions (locations) for which no local measurements are available. But how reliable are such predictions? And what determines the reliability of predictions to unobserved locations? How can this reliability, the prediction error, be estimated?\nWith digital soil mapping introduced in Block 3, here we probe its fundamental modelling paradigm - spatial upscaling. We learn how we test a (machine learning) model with a view to what it is used for - the prediction task.\nThis block serves to critically reflect on working with big data and using (black box) models. It does not introduce entirely new methods, but serves to apply methods learned in previous blocks and in AGDS I for exploring and understanding the benefits and limits of (geo) data science methods. Rather than a tutorial, it comes in the form of literature study and working with the data yourself. All students are required to hand in the Report Exercise of this block.\n\nSession 11 - 30.11.\n\nIntroduction to model generalisability and spatial upscaling\nSelf-study of literature and report exercise\n\n\n\nSession 12 - 07.12.\n\nPaper discussion of Ludwig et al. (2023)\nSelf-study of literature and report exercise",
