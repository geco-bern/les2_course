If AGDS I has not been attended, it is expected that equivalent knowledge has been gained from comparable courses in other study programs, or that contents of the Applied Geodata Science book are independently studied until October 12, 2023 (before the fourth session in fall semester 2023).\n\nThe lead for this course is by by Prof. Benjamin Stocker and co-taught with Dr. Koen Hufkens. The website is a product of the group for Geocomputation and Earth Observation, Institute of Geography, University of Bern. Individual tutorials are co-authored by different contributors."

Applications cover a diverse set of data science methods and serve to demonstrate fundamental concepts and implementations, including mechanistic modelling, unsupervised classification, and supervised machine learning. The course combines a theoretical and a hands-on component and consists of a mixture of lectures, exercises, and two (small) self-guided project (‘Report Exercises’).\nSee Course Plan for a complete overview and contextualisation of the different applications, covered by separate course blocks."

Stocker, to a git repository that contains code for two separate, reproducible workflows (RMarkdown, see here) for the two Report Exercises (vignettes/re1.Rmd and vignettes/re2.Rmd).\nOne report exercise builds on one of the tutorials of Blocks 2-4 (see Chapter 2). The second report exercise builds on Block 5 (Spatial upscaling).\nEach of the two reports will be equally weighted for the final grade.\nFor grading, we consider the following criteria:\n\nReproducibility (25%). Make sure your RMarkdown code is reproducible and generates a html document as intended. You can check this by letting a colleague clone your git repository and run your code on their machine. If it fails, it’s not reproducible, and you won’t get points for this aspect.\nWorkspace organisation and code (25%). Follow the principles for workspace organisation and coding as described in the AGDS book (here and here).\nPresentation (25%). This considers the appearance of the generated html document, its text and figures. Provide context, create good data visualisations, and discuss your findings.\nAnalysis and modelling (25%). This considers the correctness of analysis and modelling implementations, and the reasonable application of methods.\n\nEach student will hand in their own Report Exercises This is not a group work.\nCode duplications are not permitted and duplicated code will be graded with zero points for the respective Report Exercise.\nReports cannot be re-submitted after having received the grades. Make sure all is reproducible before you submit.\nDeadline for sending us the link by email: 08.01.2024 (course in fall semester 2023)."

    "text": "1.4 Note of caution\nThe use of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, for supporting code development should be considered with caution and is not permitted for writing report text. We are aware that LLMs can help solving technical tasks and the right use of LLMs for solving your problem is not discouraged. However, be aware that code produced by LLMs is not tested to be functional and error-free. Therefore, you have to understand what you get and verify and correct code with a view to your problem. Note that LLMs use text from various sources on the internet. Your report text must not contain verbatim copied text from unidentified sources. This would be considered plagiarism."

In contrast to what the cloud computing revolution promised, many ideas start out from site or localized studies. The focus of these few chapters from the Handful of Pixels book is deliberate. I will show you through both examples in vegetation seasonality (phenology) and land-use and land-cover mapping (Block 4) that you can experiment with geo-spatial data on limited compute infrastructure. Furthermore, it also shows you that true science can be done with relatively modest means.

This block introduces a workflow for digital soil mapping for using Random Forest models, predicting soil properties across a study area near Bern. The tutorial demonstrates how advances in data availability (continuous maps of climate, terrain, etc.) can be used to predict soil properties that are laborious to obtain from a limited set of soil cores (e.g., pH, water logging, etc.) and for which mapping commonly relied on spatial upscaling “by hand”. The self-guided continuation of the tutorial includes conducting variable selection, model formulation, training, evaluation, and interpretation.\n\nSession 7 - 02.11.\n\nIntroduction to digital soil mapping\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises\n\n\n\nSession 8 - 09.11.\n\nSelf-study of tutorial and exercises"

    "text": "Block 5: Spatial upscaling\nLead: Benjamin Stocker\nLink to tutorial\nCreating maps with large spatial, often global coverage based on a limited set of local measurements has become popular. Digital soil mapping led the way by introducing the paradigm that (i) maps can be created based on a model that fits relationships between a locally measured variable of interest and a set of covariates, often environmental variables; and that (ii) global maps of these covariates are available and enable predicting with the fitted model to conditions (locations) for which no local measurements are available. But how reliable are such predictions? And what determines the reliability of predictions to unobserved locations? How can this reliability, the prediction error, be estimated?\nWith digital soil mapping introduced in Block 3, here we probe its fundamental modelling paradigm - spatial upscaling. We learn how we test a (machine learning) model with a view to what it is used for - the prediction task.\nThis block serves to critically reflect on working with big data and using (black box) models. It does not introduce entirely new methods, but serves to apply methods learned in previous blocks and in AGDS I for exploring and understanding the benefits and limits of (geo) data science methods. Rather than a tutorial, it comes in the form of literature study and working with the data yourself. All students are required to hand in the Report Exercise of this block.\n\nSession 11 - 30.11.\n\nIntroduction to model generalisability and spatial upscaling\nSelf-study of literature and report exercise\n\n\n\nSession 12 - 07.12.\n\nPaper discussion of Ludwig et al. (2023)\nSelf-study of literature and report exercise"

Scoring at the level or better than the base model as demonstrated in the course is however required.\n\n3.1.1 Available data\nTraining data is generated through a random subset of 200 pixels for each class in the Fritz et al. (2017) land-use and land-cover validation dataset (following the chapter’s example but with additional data products provided). The equivalent test data for this competition consists of 600 unlabelled locations providing the same spectral information as provided in the training data. Data for the competition can be downloaded from a dedicated zenodo archive.\n\n\n3.1.2 Leaderboard submission\nYour model should be able to run on the test dataset, which puts constraints on which additional data you could download. Submit your model results run on the test dataset as a CSV file containing a table of model results (one label on each row, and a header called lulc_class).\n\n\n\n\n\nlulc_class\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n3\n\n\n5\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaderboard submissions will be accepted two (2) times during the semester, with a final submission included with your overall report.
