    "text": "Course description\nThis course is a lecture, taught at the University of Bern in the Masters program for Geography and for Climate Sciences students.\nThe course advances the introduction of fundamental processes governing terrestrial biosphere functioning. Standard and simple demonstration models will be introduced and applied for demonstrating terrestrial carbon cycle functioning and and Earth system dynamics. The course builds on Land in the Earth System 1 and deepens its scope, while covering largely the same thematic ground - from the global carbon cycle, land-climate interactions, ecohydrology, to Earth system dynamics. In addition, scientific methods, data, and research challenges will be discussed.\nThe course is organised into a mix of lectures, self-study, and student presentations. Lecture notes containing all relevant content will be made available. No podcasts will be recorded.",

The written text document answering assignment X is to be handed in one week prior to session N. Assignment X is revisited in the session one week later, where lecturers fill in gaps, contextualise, edit the submitted written document, and put the document online.

    "text": "The course is a mix of lectures by lecturers and contents taught by students.\nAn introduction and overview lecture is given at the start of the semester.\nTwo Chapters (Earth system feedbacks and Ocean CO2 uptake and emission-concentration trajectories) are taught by lecturers in the form of a lecture.\nRemaining chapters are covered by students, guided by six assignments.\n\nEach assignment specifies a set of question that covers the contents of the respective chapter. Each question is supplemented with references to the published literature where answers can be found.\nGroups of 3-4 students (number of students depending on the assignment) collaborate on the literature study, guided by answering the questions.\nThe outcome of each assignment is a text document with correct citations and complemented with visualisations from the literature. Additionally, the contents of this text document are to be presented to the class (30 min.).\n\nThe student presentations are complemented by fun lectures, given by the lecturers on a current research topic related to the assignmnets.\nThe text documents are to be handed in before the respective presentation and are edited by the lecturers. The final edited versions are made available through the Land in the Earth System “textbook-website” as Part II. (Part I covers the contents of the course Land in the Earth System 1.)\nThe contents on the website (Part II) are covered by the written exam. The fun lectures are not covered in the exam.\nThe presentations and the text documents are not graded. But their timely submission and the active engagement of each student in the presentations and in collaboratively creating the text is the prerequisite for writing the exam.\nLead: Prof. Benjamin Stocker; contributing lecturers: Dr. Laura Marqués and Dr. Fabrice Lacroix.\nCourse language is English.\nMonday 14.15-16.00 is our presence time, use it for your communication with us.\nNo email communications.",

We are aware that LLMs can help solving technical tasks and the right use of LLMs for solving your problem is not discouraged. However, correct referencing of original sources of each statement in your text is mandatory and is unreliably solved by LLMs. Therefore, you have to understand your own text and verify and correct it before submitting it. Note that LLMs use text from various sources on the internet. Your report text must not contain verbatim copied text from unidentified sources. This would be considered plagiarism.",
